  faq:
    doc_managment_services:
      answer:
        We've partnered with <strong>BarkerBlue</strong> to provide full document
        control services including the upload and management of your documents inside
        PlanGrid.
      question: Do you offer document management services?
    going_over_sheet_limit:
      answer:
        Once you go over your sheet limit, you won’t be able to upload any more
        sheets to PlanGrid, and you won’t be able to sync or download any new sheets
        on your iPad.
      question: What happens if I go over my sheet limit?
    how_to_cancel:
      answer: To cancel your account, you can <a href='/users/account'>click here</a>.
      question: How do I cancel my account?
    how_to_downgrade:
      answer:
        To downgrade your account, head to the account management page and select
        the plan you want to downgrade to. If you click the Hammer Plan, this will
        downgrade you back down to the free account, and you will no longer be charged
        by us.
      question: How do I downgrade my account?
    long_term_contract:
      answer:
        Nope. All of our monthly plans are pay-as-you-go and you can cancel
        or change plans at any time. If you choose to get an annual plan, you must
        pay for the whole year up front, but you get two months free!
      question: Do I have to sign a long-term contract?
    more_questions:
      answer: Talk to a sales representative
      question: More questions?
    payments_accepted:
      answer:
        We accept all major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express,
        Discover, JCB, and Diners Club cards) on our website. We also will take invoices,
        but only for our annual plans. If you want to pay by invoice, please <a href='#'
        onclick="olark('api.box.expand'); return false">contact us</a>.
      question: What types of payment do you accept?
    what_is_a_sheet:
      answer:
        Your sheet count is the total number of pages hosted on our system at
        any given time. You are free to add and delete sheets as much as you want
        and as long as you stay below the maximum amount allowed by your plan.
      question: What counts as a sheet?
